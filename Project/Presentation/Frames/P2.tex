    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Prove that there exists two powers of 7, whose difference is divisible by 2003.
        \pause
        \item Consider the numbers $7^0, 7^1, 7^2, \dots 7^{2004}$
        \item Let $r_0, r_1, r_2, \dots r_{2004}$ be the remainders of these 2004 numbers.
        \item There are only 2003 different remainders possible for 2003
        \item By PHP at least two of the $r_i's$ are the same say $r_a, r_b$
        \item 2003 divides $7^a - 7^b$
    \end{itemize}
