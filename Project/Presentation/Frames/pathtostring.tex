\begin{frame}{Path to String}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let us take any path, Let us construct a string such that whenever you take a right step we add 'R' at to the string and whenever you take a upward step we add 'U' to the string.
        \pause
        \item {\bf{Think about it :}} Two different strings can't represent the same path.
        \pause
        \item How many U's and R's will be there in every string that indicates a path from (0, 0) to (m, n)? and what is the length of any string?
