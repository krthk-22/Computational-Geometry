    In a party of 6 people, if you take any two members they are either friends or strangers. Then show that you can always find a group of 3 people, in which all pairs are either friends or all pairs are strangers.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Solution}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Let us treat these 6 people as 6 points and color the line segment joining them {\color{blue}{blue}} if they are friends and {\color{red}{red}} if they are strangers.

        \item To prove the statement we need to show there exists a triangle whose all edges are of the same color.
        \item Now take any point there will be 5 line segments from it to remaining 5 points.

    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Solution}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Since we have 5 lines and 2 colors, by stronger version of PHP at least {\bf{3 of these 5}} should be of the same color say {\color{blue}{blue}}.

                \draw (0, 0)--(240:2.5) [blue, very thick];

            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{figure}
        \item If any of the {\color{yellow}{yellow}} segments are {\color{blue}{blue}} we are done.
        \item Else all of them are {\color{red}{red}}. Then we will have a {\color{red}{red}} triangle.
