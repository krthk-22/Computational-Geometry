\begin{frame}{Counting Number of Strings}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There will be {\bf{n}} Us and {\bf{m}} Rs in any string because you need to take {\bf{n}} upward steps and {\bf{m}} right steps to reach the point (m, n) and length of any string is {\bf{m+n}}.
        \pause
        \item Observe that you fix the positions of U in the string then the remaining positions are occupied by R.
        \pause
        \item You can do that $^{m+n}C_m = ^{m+n}C_n$ ways.
