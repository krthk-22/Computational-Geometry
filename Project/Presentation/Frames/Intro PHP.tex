        \begin{itemize}[<+->]
            \item The Pigeon Hole Principle (also sometimes called the box principle or the Dirichlet box principle) simply states that if one wants to put pigeons in holes, and there are more pigeons than there are holes, then one of the holes has to contain more than one pigeon.
            \item {\bf{Stronger Version :}} If there are $k$ holes and there are $nk + 1$ pigeons then one of the holes has to contain more than $n$ pigeons or in other words there exists a hole that has at least $n+1$ pigeons.
