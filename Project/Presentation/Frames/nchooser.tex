\begin{frame}{Definition of $^nC_r$}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are n different objects then number of ways of choosing r objects from them is given by the number $^nC_r = {n\choose r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
        \item {\bf{Example :}} Say there are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Number of ways of choosing 2 different numbers.
        \item In the above problem we are choosing 2 out of the 5 objects ${5\choose 2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{120}{2*6} = 10$
        \item Observe that the choices (1, 2) and (2, 1) are counted as the same.
